LD28 - YOU ONLY GET ONE... EARTH

Narrator: You are the king of the great kingdom of Monaco!  You have ruled it honorably for many years.  Unfortunately, the scientist in Monaco has determined that the world will be uninhabitable within one year due to global warming!  This is likely to affect us negatively.

Scientist: Your Majesty, I do believe it's time for Monaco to step in and save the world! We shall do it by convincing all the nations of the world to abandon their selfish carbon emmissions!  How hard could it be?  Your debating skills are unmatched.

You: Aye, they are unmatched, but I swore I would never use them again!  Remember what happened last time when I debated that young man...

Scientist: That was a child, your Majesty.

You: Child, who cares.  The point is that I am forced to take up debating again!  Where do we begin?

Scientist: It begins right here.  You must convince the queen that our cause is just!

You: The horror!  She is as ruthless in love as she is in debate!
